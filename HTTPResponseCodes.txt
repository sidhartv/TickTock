It's easier to rely upon HTTP response codes, rather than parsing messages. i.e. when the back-end sends code X, that means that the front-end should do action Y.

Getting a status:
	Request a status by sending a GET request to the StatusServlet (mapped to /status).
		MUST INCLUDE PARAMETERS:
			-username - (user to get statuses from)
			-time - date/time string (in MySQL format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS, where HH is in 24-hour clock mode). Can also be "current" to represent current time
	Response types:
	-200 = all good! The status of the user at the time is provided as a JSON object with username (not ID), status, and the time that the status was posted.
	-204 = all good, but no data to send back. Do whatever you need to render a lack of statuses made by this user.
	-412 = you ended up in Pittsburgh. Tell the user to get Primantis. Just kidding. A parameter was missing, or was invalid
	-500 = something went very wrong on the server side (either a bad connection to MySQL...or something like that)

Setting your own status:
	Set your status by sending a POST request to the StatusServlet (mapped to /status)
		MUST INCLUDE PARAMETERS:
		-userID (you know this, so use the ID, not the name)
		-status (you know...the actual thing)
		-expiry (the time that this status should expire)
	Response types:
		-204 = all good. You won't get anything back if the post is successful. Up to the front end what to do if we successfully post the status.
		-412 = malformed parameters. Can occur if user ID does not exist, or expiry is not a well-formed date
		-500 = something went very wrong on the server side
		
Getting pending friend requests: 
	-See who has friended you, or who you have friended by sending a GET request to the FriendRequestServlet (mapped to /friend_requests)
	-MUST INCLUDE PARAMETERS:
		-id - YOUR user id
		-party - equal to "target" if you want to see who has friended you or "initiator" to see who you've friended
	Response types:
	-200 = all good! Returns a JSON object containing an array of friend requests, each of which have the usernames of the initiator and target, along with the MySQL formatted date-time at which the request was sent
	-204 = all good, but no data to send back because there are no pending friend requests
	-412 = invalid parameters. Either the id provided is invalid, or the party is neither equal to "target" nor "initiator"
	-500 = server side error...welp
	
Making friend requests:
	-Send a POST request to the FriendRequestServlet, with parameter type="request"
	-MUST INCLUDE PARAMETERS:
		-me - your user ID
		-other - the other person's user name
		-type - set equal to "request" for this action
	Response types:
	-204 = all good. Servlet returns nothing when request is successful
	-412 = malformed parameters. Either you and the other person are already friends, a friend request already exists, a/the user(s) cannot be found, or type is invalid
	-500 = server side error

Approving friend requests:
	-Send a POST request to the FriendRequestServlet, with parameter type="approval"
	-MUST INCLUDE PARAMETERS:
		-me - your user ID
		-other - the other person's user name
		-type - set equal to "approval" for this action
	Response types:
	-204 = all good. Servlet returns nothing when approval is successful
	-412 = malformed parameters. Either you and the other person are already friends, a friend request does not exist, a/the user(s) cannot be found, or type is invalid
	-500 = server side error	
	
Getting a list of friends:
	-Send a GET request to the FriendList servlet (mapped to /friend_list)
	-MUST INCLUDE PARAMETER:
		-user - username of the person whose friend list we wish to acquire
	Response types:
		-200 = all good. Servlet returns a JSON array containing a list of usernames
		-204 = all good. Servlet returns nothing when person has no friends :'(
		-412 = malformed parameters. User does not exist in DB.
		-500 = severe server side error
