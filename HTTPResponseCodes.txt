It's easier to rely upon HTTP response codes, rather than parsing messages. i.e. when the back-end sends code X, that means that the front-end should do action Y.

Getting a status:
	Request a status by sending a get request to the StatusServlet (to be mapped to a URI later).
		MUST INCLUDE PARAMETERS:
			username - (user to get statuses from)
			time - date/time string (in MySQL format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS, where HH is in 24-hour clock mode). Can also be "current" to represent current time
	Response types:
	-200 = all good! The status of the user at the time is provided as a JSON object with username (not ID), status, and the time that the status was posted.
	-204 = all good, but no data to send back. Do whatever you need to render a lack of statuses made by this user.
	-412 = you ended up in Pittsburgh. Tell the user to get Primantis. Just kidding. A parameter was missing
	-500 = something went very wrong on the server side (either a bad connection to MySQL...or something like that)
