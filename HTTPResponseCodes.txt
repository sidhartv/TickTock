It's easier to rely upon HTTP response codes, rather than parsing messages. i.e. when the back-end sends code X, that means that the front-end should do action Y.

Getting a status:
	Request a status by sending a GET request to the StatusServlet (mapped to /status).
		MUST INCLUDE PARAMETERS:
			-username - (user to get statuses from)
			-time - date/time string (in MySQL format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS, where HH is in 24-hour clock mode). Can also be "current" to represent current time
	Response types:
	-200 = all good! The status of the user at the time is provided as a JSON object with username (not ID), status, and the time that the status was posted.
	-204 = all good, but no data to send back. Do whatever you need to render a lack of statuses made by this user.
	-412 = you ended up in Pittsburgh. Tell the user to get Primantis. Just kidding. A parameter was missing, or was invalid
	-500 = something went very wrong on the server side (either a bad connection to MySQL...or something like that)

Setting your own status:
	Set your status by sending a POST request to the StatusServlet (mapped to /status)
		MUST INCLUDE PARAMETERS:
		-userID (you know this, so use the ID, not the name)
		-status (you know...the actual thing)
		-expiry (the time that this status should expire)
	Response types:
		-204 = all good. You won't get anything back if the post is successful. Up to the front end what to do if we successfully post the status.
		-412 = malformed parameters. Can occur if user ID does not exist, or expiry is not a well-formed date
		-500 = something went very wrong on the server side
